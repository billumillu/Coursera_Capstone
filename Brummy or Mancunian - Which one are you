Although a great place to visit, London isn\u2019t necessarily affordable by everyone as a place to live. Due to this, many prefer living in a city close to London so that not only can they live in a bigger house for a lower rent, and save on many other things while earning a decent income, but also can drop in London within an hour or two. Smart.\n\nA problem with this approach is that if you just want a quick night-out, maybe go to a fancy restaurant, or visit a museum, or a park, you shouldn\u2019t have to sit in a train for over an hour, every single time. The city you choose should have things to do that you prefer.\n\nWhat then, is the next best thing? \n\nA quick Google search revealed people prefer either Birmingham or Manchester. Many say Birmingham\u2019s better, even better than London, while many side with Manchester. \n\nBut which one\u2019s better for you?\n"
