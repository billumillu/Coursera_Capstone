# Brummy or Mancunian - Which one are you

# Introduction
When we think of UK, we think of London. Although a great place to visit, London isn’t necessarily affordable by everyone as a place to live. Due to this, many prefer living in a city close to London so that not only can they live in a bigger house for a lower rent, and save on many other things while earning a decent income, but also can drop in London within an hour or two. Smart.

A problem with this approach is that if you just want a quick night-out, maybe go to a fancy restaurant, or visit a museum, or a park, you shouldn’t have to sit in a train for over an hour, every single time. The city you choose should have things to do that you prefer.

What then, is the next best thing?

A quick Google search revealed people prefer either Birmingham or Manchester. Many say Birmingham’s better, even better than London, while many side with Manchester.

But which one’s better for you?
